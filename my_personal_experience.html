<p>This is picture when I was form 6. There was picture when I had camping at Batalion ke 5 Renjer Diraja.It was my sweet memories and sad memories when I was there. I had camping there for 3 days 2 night.</p>

<p>This is the sad memories when I was camping. It so hard for me this activity. This activity that we must enter the water and walk until the challenge are solve. The water is very deep and mud. It was very hard to walk and make us more sinking. It was the worst memorable that I had when I'm camping here.</p>

<p>When I was form 6 I'm enter to art class. However I'm not from art class when I was form 5. I still try until I can perform in art class. When I was form 5 actually I was from science class. I learn about biology, chemistry, physics and else. But I cannot get awesome result in SPM. That's why i enter to form 6 and take art class. It make me more open minded when I was form 6. Art also can make someone successful not just science courses.</p>
